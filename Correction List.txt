Games Bug

* When Heydrich kills Himmler the leader Himmler should also die. More generally, when the SS is purged, several SS ministers+leaders survive, intended?
* Nehru has the wrong picture in India
* Ceylon doesn't have any ministers, even when it had a "Change of government" event
* Defeated Romania, ceded Bessarabia/Odessa to RK Ukraine, then reestablished Romania which had Nikolayev province as an enclave inside Ukrainian territory.
* RK Norwegen had the "United Ostland" event
* Dewey as President, but Truman as Vicepresident, why?
* The Cossack Republic event in which Soviets get rebels in their country should lead to an automatic cancellation of the Non-Aggression pact as per "We can attack them when we want but they are protected by Germany"
* RK Schweiz has not correct counter
* SS has not correct counter
* AI of Spain and Hungary don't work correctly (the use default correct ?). They have all the division in the capital.
* Germany has 90000520NAME event 
* Romania has 90000538B event 
* Lokot has 90000538A event
* The SS ferocity may be incremented cause they have a white peace with Germany after they have inherit Ukraine.

Forum's Feedback

* Vichy France is not protected by Germany. If France Vichy is attacked by Allies Germany must intervene.
* Germany-Cossacks unexpected war after the Volga Conference. Eventually made aftermath events(with a possible rename of Stalingrad ?).
* Spy war in Swiss, the options of shoot out a swiss airport are only -1/+1 of dissent. Implement the options.
* The "Reorganization of Ukraine" does nothing if the Cossack Federation does not exist.
* The Sinkiang Fate release only the Capital of Sinkiang cause the SU has core on the region.
* After soviet union chooses beria and begin the purges, siberia gets an event without a real name: 8014270NAME
* There's not a surrender event if Germany invade Italy after them leave axis
* Australia left the allies without event/reason
* If you choose to nuke test on london and Ireland is already nazi, nothing happens (london should at least get destroyed or damaged?)
* Despite heydrich killing himmler, himmler is still head of state of crimea
* After ostland grabs leningrad germany should remove its claim on it because if ostland is still allied with you they will just give it back
* I left Romania and Hungary to fight it out over Transylvania, but then Hungary got couped by the allies in the middle of it ( The war continued though).
* If a nation of axis become democratic the Axis must intervene.
