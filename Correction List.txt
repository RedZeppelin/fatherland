Games Bug

* GER : Banat feed reich - Review Trigger
* When Heydrich kills Himmler the leader Himmler should also die. More generally, when the SS is purged, several SS ministers+leaders survive, intended?
* Nehru has the wrong picture in India
* Ceylon doesn't have any ministers, even when it had a "Change of government" event
* Defeated Romania, ceded Bessarabia/Odessa to RK Ukraine, then reestablished Romania which had Nikolayev province as an enclave inside Ukrainian territory.
* RK Norwegen had the "United Ostland" event
* Dewey as President, but Truman as Vicepresident, why?
* The Cossack Republic event in which Soviets get rebels in their country should lead to an automatic cancellation of the Non-Aggression pact as per "We can attack them when we want but they are protected by Germany"
