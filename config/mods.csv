Chiang and his close advisors feel that the system is crumbling and he must act quick if the unification process is to succeed. On the nearest assembly of the all-China parliament he is going to demand that Communists disband their militias and accept governmental administration in their deepest strongholds. The proposal has a slim chance of success but by no means it's a sensible demand and Communist moderates may prevail to accept our terms.\n\nYou may choose to use all your influence and press hard on the issue or just suggest discussion on the subject.
