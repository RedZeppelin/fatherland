	desc = "The German people have never suffered too much undernourishment during the Second World War, in contrary to most involved countries. In fact, the Germans lived in relative luxury, fueled by Germany's growing conquests. Only in the latter years, there were some forms of rationing in the country. After the war, the government never fully abolished those programs, due to the closed world market and troubles with increasing argicultural levels in specifically the Lebensraum in the East. However, it was during Hitler 59th birthday all food rationing were abolished - in the actual Fatherland, that was. Many other parts of German-influenced Europe still lived in relative poverty."
